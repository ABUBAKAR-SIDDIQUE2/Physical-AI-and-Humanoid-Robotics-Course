# Hardware Requirements

## 1. Overview

Physical AI is compute-intensive. Simulating photorealistic worlds and running large VLA models requires powerful hardware. Below are the specifications for this course.

## 2. The Workstation (for Simulation)

You need a powerful laptop or desktop to run the "Digital Twin".

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| **CPU** | Intel i7 (10th Gen) / AMD Ryzen 7 | Intel i9 (13th Gen) / AMD Ryzen 9 |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA RTX 3060 (6GB VRAM) | NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) |
| **RAM** | 32 GB | 64 GB+ |
| **Storage** | 500 GB SSD | 2 TB NVMe SSD |

*Note: NVIDIA GPU is strict requirement for Isaac Sim.*

## 3. The Robot (Optional but Recommended)

We focus on the **Unitree G1** Humanoid Agent.

-   **Height**: ~1.3m
-   **Weight**: ~35kg
-   **DoF**: 23-43 (depending on hand configuration)
-   **Sensors**: 3D LiDAR, Depth Camera, RealSense D435i
-   **Onboard Compute**: Jetson Orin (High Performance)

## 4. The Network

Robots are wireless. You need a dedicated Wi-Fi 6 Router (AX3000 or better) to ensure low-latency communication between your workstation and the robot.

## 5. Summary

Ensure you have access to an NVIDIA-powered machine. If you don't have a physical robot, the Workstation specs are sufficient to complete the entire course in Simulation.
