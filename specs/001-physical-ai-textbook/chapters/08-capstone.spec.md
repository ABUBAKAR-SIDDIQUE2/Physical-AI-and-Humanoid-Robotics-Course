# Chapter Spec: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

**ID**: `08-capstone`
**Title**: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid
**Folder**: `capstone-autonomous-humanoid`
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Integrate ROS 2, Perception, VLA, and Voice into a complete autonomous system.
- Architect a robust Behavior Tree for complex mission logic.
- Execute a "Butler Task": Navigate to a location, identify an object, manipulate it, and return.
- Document and present the final system design.

## Structure
1. **Overview**: The final test. Putting it all together.
2. **The Challenge**: "The Tidy-Up Task".
3. **Architecture Reference**:
   - High-level decision making (Behavior Tree).
   - Mid-level planning (Nav2, MoveIt).
   - Low-level control (Hardware Interface).
4. **Execution Plan**:
   - Week 1: Simulation Setup & Mapping.
   - Week 2: Perception & Grasping.
   - Week 3: Voice & Logic Integration.
   - Week 4: Deployment & Demo.
5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Reliability (Success rate over 10 trials).
   - Autonomy (No human intervention allowed).
6. **Summary**: You are now a Physical AI Engineer.
7. **Assessment**: The final project demo.
