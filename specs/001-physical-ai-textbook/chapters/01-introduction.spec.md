# Chapter Spec: Introduction to Physical AI

**ID**: `01-introduction`
**Title**: Introduction to Physical AI
**Folder**: `introduction-to-physical-ai`
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from purely digital AI.
- Understand the concept of "Embodied Intelligence".
- Overview the course structure and the role of ROS 2, Simulation, and Humanoids.
- Setup the development environment (Ubuntu, ROS 2, VS Code).

## Structure
1. **Overview**: What is Physical AI? The convergence of AI, Robotics, and Physics.
2. **Why This Matters**: The shift from chatbots to robots that act in the world.
3. **Key Concepts**:
   - Embodied Intelligence
   - The loop: Sense -> Plan -> Act
   - Sim-to-Real Transfer
4. **Detailed Explanations**:
   - Comparison: Generative AI vs. Physical AI.
   - The challenge of the real world (gravity, friction, noise).
5. **Hands-On Activity**: "Hello World" of Robotics - Setting up the dev environment.
6. **Summary**: Recap of the journey ahead.
7. **Assessment**: Quiz on core definitions.
