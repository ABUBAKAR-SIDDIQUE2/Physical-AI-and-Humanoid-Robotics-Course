# Specification Quality Checklist: Create Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Uses Docusaurus as requested by product definition.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *Mentions Docusaurus/GitHub Pages as they are the product deliverables.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification relies on specific tools (Docusaurus, Spec-Kit, Gemini CLI) as they are part of the core "deliverables" definition in the prompt.
